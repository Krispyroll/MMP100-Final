    <!--<p>Short paragraph introducing the story. What is it about? Why did you make it? If it is related to a political/social cause, how would you summarize the message you are trying to convey?</p> -->
    <p>class="jura-regular"> I was really inspired to try to recapture one of the most memorable games from my childhood, Galaga. So, in order to test myself, I wanted to create a game where you were able to dodge, had health points, and were able to play it continually if you wanted. This game is fairly simple; you just control the ship using your mouse and navigate through the obstacles.</p>
