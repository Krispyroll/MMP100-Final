    <h1 class="orbitron-title"> SPACESHIP DODGE</h1>
    <h2 class="jura-paragraph"> By Peter Liu</h2>
    <!--<p>Short paragraph introducing the story. What is it about? Why did you make it? If it is related to a political/social cause, how would you summarize the message you are trying to convey?</p> -->
    <p class="jura-paragraph"> I was really inspired to try to recapture a memorable game from my childhood, Galaga.<br>So, I wanted to recreate that feeling in P5, I wanted to create a game where you were able to dodge, had health points, and consists of vector graphics.<br>This game is fairly simple; you just control the ship using your mouse and navigate through the obstacles.</p>
